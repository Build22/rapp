# Rapp

Rapp - The Ruby App Scaffolder

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rapp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rapp

## Usage

Using Rapp is incredibly simple. It's designed to work like familiar scaffolders / builders in the ruby community (think `rails new`).

Currently, Rapp is in early development, and additional features are forthcoming. There is a Roadmap at the bottom of the Readme to highlight some of the work I feel is important to prioritize before a full v1 release. In addition to features, this includes the internal organization of the code as well, as the current state is more prototypical than it is final release quality.

### Ethos

Rapp is not a framework for running an app or building an app from pieces-parts. In the future, there may be additional helpers to configure very common components in the ruby community, but the overall goal is to hand you a working application with a few common niceties, then get out of your way. Once you've generated the Rapp, the project is yours to do with as you see fit - the gem itself is not a dependencty of the app you create.

Rapps are shells to house your app, in a familiar layout, to prevent you from having to write the same boring boilerplate time and time again.

Rapp is in no way shape or form meant for building web applications. You are free to attempt this if you wish, but if thats your goal, you're much better off with Rails, Sinatra, pure Rack, or any number of alternatives.

### Creating a new Rapp

Creating a new Rapp is simple

```shell
rapp my_new_rapp
```

The only requirement is that the directory must not exist as a safegaurd against accidentally overwriting any existing projects. Otherwise, thats it!

If the command executed successuflly, you should see a report displaying the folders and files that Rapp created for you. After that, you're ready to start building your app!

### Dependencies

Rapp only installs 2 dependencies into your application - bundler and rake. Eventually, It will also include rspec, as well as a suite of specs for you to run to validate that the core underpinnings of Rapp are working as expected, in addition to your own custom specs.

### Layout

Rapp application structure looks like the following:

* app/
* app/models/
* app/services/
* app/jobs/
* bin/
* config/
* config/environments/
* config/initializers/
* lib/
* lib/tasks/
* spec/
* {app_name}.rb
* {app_name}_base.rb
* Gemfile
* Rakefile

### {app_name}.rb

This is the primary entry point for you application. It includes {app_name}_base to handle booting and requiring all the dependencies. The class itself is empty, and the only code that specifically resides in this file is adding the current directory to the load path, so it can more easily locate {app_name}_base. All other code for additions to the load path, requiring bundler dependencies, etc etc resides in {app_name}_base.

### {app_name}_base.rb

Most of the generated code that Rapp creates lives here, such as:

* Defining the environment
* Providing an application level logger
* Loading dependencies via Bundler
* Adding core directories to the load path
* Requiring configuration, initializers, and environment-specific settings
* Requiring the contents of the app/ directory

You're free to modify any of this code however you see fit - however, most of the code in your core app file is meant to be added to (and not removed) for the convenience of you, the developer. Be that as it may, you are still free to do whatever you want inside of this file.

### App directory

This is likely a familiar concept to any Rails developer, with a few twists. Rails famously eschews the notion of keeping business logic in services - I do not eschew this practice, and believe it is the right way to keep a distinction between the logic of the application, and the data with which the application is modeled. You are free to use, ignore, remove, or otherwise throw out this directory as you see fit.

Additionally, there is a directory for "jobs", a place for daemonized background or out of band work to go, to make working with things like Chore or Sidekiq easier out of the box.

### Bin directory

If your application were to require an executable binary, it would be placed here. Otherwise, you may feel free to remove this directory

### Config directory

Another familiar convention for Rails developers, this directory and it's structure is meant to work in the same fashion as Rails. Dependency specific configuration needs can be placed into config/, initializers for your apps boot-up can be placed into config/initializers/, and any code specific to an environment (production / development / test) can be placed into config/environments. The load order is as follows:

1. The correct environment.rb (defaults to development)
2. The contents of config/initializers/, in alphabetical order
3. The contents of config/, in alphabetical order

These are loaded after Bundler, but before anything in app/

### Lib directory

Used for the same purpose as a Rails app or Ruby gem. Any code that falls outside of the norms of app/ would be placed here. Additionally, you may place tasks in lib/tasks/, and they will be registered via the Rake integration

### Spec directory

Mostly reserved for future use, this is where both Rapp specific specs to ensure the well-being of your core application will reside, as well as application specific specs that you write to ensure your custom logic and behaviors are working correctly (You are writing tests... right?)

### Rake

Currently, Rapp comes with 1 predefined rake task, which is "console". This will boot up irb while loading your {app_name}.rb, which will load the rest of your app. This is aliased to "c" for convenience.

## Roadmap

At the moment, this gem serves to fit a need that I found myself having and figured others might be as well. To that end, my main goals are to provide a simple, stable core ruby app intended to be run as a simple cli program, daemonized process, or otherwise. Currently, my primary roadmap for development is:

1. Generate specs for the users application
2. Test ease of use integrating Chore / Sidekiq like job systems

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/StabbyCutyou/rapp/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
